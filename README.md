**Market Basket Analysis Project** üõíüìä

## Overview üìã

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a powerful technique used by retailers and businesses to identify relationships between products frequently purchased together by customers. In this project, we will perform Market Basket Analysis using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and the Apriori algorithm from the Apyori library.

## Project Objectives üéØ

1. Conduct Market Basket Analysis on transactional data to discover frequent itemsets and association rules.
2. Unearth hidden patterns and correlations between products in customer transactions.
3. Visualize the results to derive valuable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Project Dependencies üõ†Ô∏è

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Apyori

Install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib apyori
```

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used for this project should contain transactional data with each row representing a transaction and columns representing items purchased. Ensure that the dataset is in the format of a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a transaction containing items.
The dataset used by me is uploaded in the repository above.

## Steps to Perform Market Basket Analysis üìà

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Read and load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing, such as removing duplicates or handling missing values.

2. **Apriori Algorithm:**
   - Implement the Apriori algorithm using the Apyori library.
   - Set the minimum support, confidence, and lift thresholds based on the desired level of significance.

3. **Market Basket Analysis:**
   - Apply the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and association rules in the dataset.
   - Obtain the support, confidence, and lift values for each association rule.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the results of the Market Basket Analysis to gain insights.
   - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations like bar charts or graphs to showcase the frequent itemsets and association rules.

5. **Interpretation:**
   - Interpret the generated association rules to identify meaningful patterns and relationships between products.
   - Determine which products are often purchased together and understand customer preferences.

6. **Top Association Rules:**
   - Extract and display the top association rules based on criteria such as support, confidence, or lift.
   - Use Pandas to create a DataFrame for the top association rules for easy reference.

## Understanding the Code

**Cleaning Text Data in DataFrame**

In data analysis and preprocessing, it's essential to ensure that text data is clean and standardized for accurate insights and efficient processing. In this example, we'll demonstrate how to clean text data in a DataFrame using the `.str.strip()` function in Python's Pandas library.

Suppose we have a DataFrame called `cust_level`, containing a column named 'itemDescription' with text data that may have leading and trailing whitespaces:

The original `cust_level` DataFrame looks like this:

```
  itemDescription
0       Apple
1       Banana
2       Orange
3       Mango
4       Grapes
```

To clean the text data and remove leading and trailing whitespaces, we can use the `.str.strip()` function:

```python
cust_level['itemDescription'] = cust_level['itemDescription'].str.strip()
```

After applying `.str.strip()`, the DataFrame will be updated as follows:

```
  itemDescription
0           Apple
1          Banana
2          Orange
3           Mango
4          Grapes
```

As you can see, the leading and trailing whitespaces have been removed from the 'itemDescription' column, ensuring that the text data is clean and standardized for further analysis or processing. Cleaning text data is crucial in data preprocessing to maintain consistency and accuracy in your analyses.

**Resampling Time-Series Data with Pandas**

In data analysis, time-series data often requires manipulation and analysis at different time frequencies. The `resample()` function in pandas provides a powerful tool to efficiently handle time-series data by changing its frequency and applying aggregation or transformation functions. Let's explore how to use `resample()` to resample time-series data at a monthly frequency.

The code snippet `df_date.resample('M')` means that we are resampling the DataFrame to group the data on a monthly basis. The `'M'` argument specifies the monthly frequency:

1. `resample()`: The `resample()` function in pandas allows us to change the frequency of time-series data. It's used to group the data based on a specified time frequency.

2. `'M'`: The argument `'M'` stands for monthly. It tells pandas to group the data by months.

After using `df_date.resample('M')`, the data in the DataFrame will be grouped by months. At this point, you can apply aggregation functions such as `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.count()`, etc., to calculate metrics for each month or perform further analysis on the monthly data.

For example, if you want to get the sum of values for each month, you can use `df_date.resample('M').sum()`. This will return a new DataFrame where each row represents the sum of values for a specific month.

Using the `resample()` function is particularly useful when working with time-series data from various sources, allowing you to easily analyze the data at different time frequencies (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and gain valuable insights into patterns and trends over time.

Feel free to incorporate `resample()` into your time-series data analysis workflow to efficiently handle different time frequencies and perform insightful analyses! üìÖüìà
